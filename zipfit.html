						<h2>Research &amp; Analysis </h2>
						<br>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Introduction to the problem</h3>
						<p> We started out with specific stores within the Gap corporation umbrella that included Old Navy,
							Gap and Banana Republic. Through research, we realized that our final design would <b>encompass and
							benefit NOT just the Gap brands, but similar stores across the retail
							platform</b>. Therefore, we expanded our focus to incorporate general clothing stores.
						</p>
						<p>
							The biggest issue that we found and wanted to improve was the fitting room process.
							Our research repeatedly found <b>customers were 71% more likely to purchase an item after
							trying it on</b>, making the fitting room a huge influencing factor when customers decide to purchase.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our problem space was refined to developing a system that will help customers be able to
							choose an item and get a fitting room more quickly and efficiently, while improving customer
							service productivity and helping communication between customers and store associates.
						</p>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Understanding the User</h3>
						<img class="pure-img float-right" src="images/affinitymap2.png" alt="" style="max-height:450px;"/>

						<h4>Interviews</h4>
						<p>Interviews were conducted to learn about users' shopping habits, pain points, and most importantly
							what they wanted to improve.
							The insights from people’s definition of and ideal shopping experience helped to develop
							our design concept.</p>

						<h4>Affinity mapping</h4>
						<p>Affinity mapping helped to analyze interview results, which revealed trends in the data.</p>

						<h4> Personas </h4>
						<p>Personas were created to help us target users needs and focus on helping users achieve their goals
							throughout the retail process.</p>
						<img class="pure-img personas" src="images/Gary.png" alt=""/>
						<img class="pure-img personas" src="images/Gabrielle.png" alt=""/>
						<img class="pure-img personas" src="images/Gloria.png" alt=""/>
						<p style="text-align:center">Personas from left to right: Gary, Gabrielle, Gloria</p>

						<h4>Customer Journey Mapping </h4>
						<p>In-context role playing and observations helped us identify the pain points in the traditional
							shopping experience. The insight gathered helped us find potential areas that we could develop
							design solutions for.</p>

						<h4> Storyboards </h4>
						<p> Storyboards were used to demonstrate the shopping experience in order to clarify the problems we were trying to solve for.</p>

						<img class="pure-img personas" src="images/storyboard2.jpg" alt=""/>
						<p style="text-align:center">Storyboards</p>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Findings</h3>
						<p>Retail customers who visit the fitting rooms are <b>71%</b> more likely to purchase items than people who
							just browse the sales floor. To us, this meant that fitting rooms play a pivotal role
						in customers' ultimate decision-making process.
						<br>
						We discovered various problems with how current fitting rooms operate:</p>
						<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
							<li> In order to get another size, customers have to put their clothing back on.</li>
							<li> Dirty fitting rooms make a bad impression </li>
							<li> Lighting and mirrors aren't flattering. </li>
							<li> Lines are too long.</li>
							<li> Sometimes fitting rooms have item restrictions.</li>
						</ul>

					<div id="design" class="design">
						<br>
						<h2>Design</h2>
						<br>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Requirements</h3>
						<p>
							The core functionality of our design solution should deal with the following points:
						</p>
						<ul style="text-align:left;">
							<li>Helping the user choose the right size and style</li>
							<li>Having better physical features in fitting room facilities</li>
							<li>Making customer services more efficient and flexible</li>
							<li>Allowing customers to have more control over their shopping and fitting room process</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Our final design solution should focus primarily on interactive technology that will help the general
							population of shoppers and attendants communicate about sizes and product availability more
							effectively and efficiently, while also giving the customer more control over the process of
							finding clothes that fit well to increase incentive to purchase them.
						</p>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Ideation</h3>
						<p>During our brainstorm phase, we came up with three different ideas;
							a personalized customer service solution, an independent usage system, and a body scanner/kiosk system.</p>
						<h4>Personalized Customer Service</h4>
						<img class="pure-img mockups" src="images/personalized.png" alt="">
						<br>
						<br>
						<h4>Tablet and Independent Usage</h4>
						<img class="pure-img mockups" src="images/independentusage.png" alt="">
						<br>
						<br>
						<h4>Body Scanner and Kiosk</h4>
						<img class="pure-img mockups" src="images/bodyscannerkiosk.png" alt="">

						<br>
						<br>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Feedback</h3>
						<p>
							We presented our final three solutions to four participants, asking them various questions
							about our design ideas. A consensus appeared where many of the participants preferred design solution 2,
							the tablet focused solution. Based on their feedback, we re-designed this solution to incorporate
							some main suggestions and also wireframed the screens for a second round of feedback sessions.
						</p>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Feedback Questions</h3>
						<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
							<li>Is this something that they would use? (Usability, does the system meet the user needs?)</li>
							<li>Which feature would make you most likely to use it? (Does user perceive the benefits of the system?)</li>
							<li>Do you think this system would help make customer service faster?
								(Identified user need from previous research)</li>
							<li>Would this would allow you to have more control over your shopping and fitting room experience?
								(Identified user need from previous research)</li>
							<li>Is there anything you want to change or add? (Usability, informing next design iteration(s).)</li>
							<li>Which solution would be more useful? (Informing next design iteration(s).)</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;">Feedback Results</h3>

						<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
							<li>Independently Shopping vs. Shopping with Associate Assistance -
								Participants think the tablet or smartphone can give them more independence.</li>
							<li>Feasibility and Accuracy - The body scanning/kiosk concept was NOT as practical
								or achievable as the other two concepts.</li>
							<li>Come back later to try on - Provide estimated waiting time before customers confirm a request.</li>
							<li>Tablet or smartphone - Customers don’t want to download multiple apps for every store.</li>
							<li>Privacy - For the body scanning/kiosk concept, privacy is the biggest problem that
								we cannot solve currently.</li>
							<li>Store Associates - Having enough excellent associates could be difficult to achieve. How many associates the store
								can hire depends on the company.</li>
							<li>How can I find right size? - Trying on another size is still necessary for all solutions except
								the scanning/kiosk idea.</li>

						<p class="protopara">
							We asked four users to critique our wireframes, asking them the same set of questions that we
							used for the sketch designs in our ideation phase. During the wireframe stage, we also included a
							longer question with a 1-to-7 Likert scale where we asked the subjects to rate different features
							of the prototype:
						<p>
						<p>
							<b>On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being “Hate it” and 7 being “Love it,”
								how would you rank the following features?</b>

							</div>
						</div>

						<p class="protopara">
							While the responses were scaled, the subjects were still encouraged to “think aloud”
							and comment on the prototype. The purpose of this question was to gather user feedback
							to inform our design process as we iterated. User feedback on the various features helped
							our decision-making process regarding features and changes in subsequent iterations.

						<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
							<li> Language: Our system should provide language settings where users can select a prefered language.</li>
							<li> Illiterate Population: One way to do this is to have an audio reader for the texts,
								telling them which button to press using visual indication, but using the same interface.
								The other way is to have the system switch to using an entirely auditorial mode where the
								customer interacts with the system using audio commands. </li>
							<li> “Help” Option: We decided that we should include a tutorial for the system after we received
								feedback regarding this, but it is still useful to have a “help” option. This can be used to call
								assistants for service, getting tips for using the system, etc. </li>
							<li> Color Contrast: Make sure colors are visible and easily contrasted </li>
							<li> Font Size: Normal text is in 24 pt font, large text for important messages are in 30 pt font,
								small paragraphs and trivial information are in 18 pt and 14 pt font. </li>
							<li> Text Readability: We are using Roboto for our font. Since there are no long paragraphs on
								our system, the sans-serif fonts allow better legibility.</li>
							<li> Button Size and Status: We have the buttons big enough and easily differentiable for users to
								reduce their chances of making mistakes. The buttons will have a reaction when pressed to give

					<h2>Testing and Evaluation</h2>

					<h3 style="text-align:left;">3 Cognitive Walkthroughs</h3>

					<p>
						By using ‘expert’ users for cognitive walkthroughs, we wanted to determine whether specific
						tasks and their action sequences to complete the tasks were comprehensible and executable.
						We also wanted to determine if there was enough feedback given to the user for them to know
						that the task was successful.
					</p>

					<p>
						Having ‘expert’ users test the system allowed us to hone in on specific key tasks within our design
						that we wanted to have evaluated. This gave us a chance to further define what was confusing, what
						was successful and what wasn’t. It also allowed us to understand the weaknesses of the design and how
						we could resolve tasks that resulted in failures for the ‘expert’ user. Ideally, this would allow us
						to refine the design before having real users test the system when doing usability tests, but due to
						time constraints, we were unable to do this.

					<h4> Questions asked after each step in the action sequences:</h4>
					<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
						<li>What is the user’s task?</li>
						<li>Will the user know what the correct action is?</li>
						<li>Will the user be able to tell what action will achieve their task?</li>
						<li>Will the user receive any feedback regarding if the task was successful or not?</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 style="text-align:left;">5 Usability Tests</h3>
					<p>Through usability testing, we wanted to get feedback from users to identify any usability problems and
						to collect quantitative and qualitative data to determine their satisfaction with our design.
						Specifically, we wanted to know if people could use our system easily and smoothly, if they were
						able to get the item they wanted, if our app solved their problems, and if
						there was anything that could be improved upon.
					</p>

					<p>
						Usability testing gave us the chance to identify problems before the design is coded. The earlier
						issues are identified and solved, the less work is needed later. Through usability testing, we
						determined if users were able to complete specified tasks successfully and found out how
						satisfied participants were with our solution.

					<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
						<li> <b>Roles:</b> 1 moderator, 1 notetaker, 1 playing store assistant, 1 facilitator</li>
						<li> <b>Artifacts: </b> We set up the physical space into 3 separate spaces: store-front,
							fitting room, back storage. We provided a tablet with our prototype implemented, and
							created fake clothes on hangers that were displayed as samples.
						</li>
						<li> <b>Procedure: </b>We explained our prototype and the evaluation activity to participants.
							We gave them the same set of tasks that we used in the expert evaluation, but added in the physical
							interactions with store associates and artifacts to provide a more virtual, in-context experience.
							We asked participants to think aloud during the evaluation.</li>
						<li> After users completed the tasks, we asked 2 probing questions to gauge their experience:
							<br>
								<b>Is this more helpful than a traditional system/fitting room experience?
								<br>
								What would you like to improve or change about this process?</b></li>
						<li>Users also completed a SUS survey.</li>

					<h3 style="text-align:left;">Main Findings</h3>

					<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
						<li>Confused by what “call” means, phone number or name?</li>
						<li>Don’t know whether adding more items will change the waiting time to go try on.</li>
						<li>The system should suggest fitting rooms to be assigned to them when they send the clothes to store</li>
						<li>Wait time is long.</li>
						<li>Confused about where to find change sizes.</li>
						<li>Want to see change size (color) option directly on screen once they get in the fitting room.</li>

					<h3 style="text-align:left;">User Centered Design</h3>
					<img class="pure-img float-right" src="images/UCD.png" alt="" style="max-width: 500px;"/>
					<p>
						We utilized the user centered design process by first researching the problem space, then
						ideating and designing, prototyping, evaluating and testing and lastly iterating again and again.
						This method argues that this is always a formative process and
						it never reaches the summative process, because the solution can always be improved upon.
					</p>

					<h3 style="text-align:left;">Improvements</h3>
					<p>
						ZipFit was only a semester long project. Given the opportunity to continue, here's what we would
						do to move forward with our design:
					</p>

					<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
						<li>Launch a survey to help us determine understandable terminology.</li>
						<li>Remove the wait time for pulling up items.</li>
						<li>Enable the functionality to choose more than one size.</li>
						<li>Make the change size or color option directly show up when in the fitting room.</li>
						<li>Make the tabs for the main shopping page and item list more prominent, and highlight the
							selected tab with a better color contrast.</li>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<br>

					<h3 style="text-align:left">Teamwork and Project Management</h3>
					<p class="protopara">
						The biggest takeaway I got from this project was learning how to work in a team with people
						that had very different
						dynamics and skill sets. By utilizing a project progress spreadsheet, we were able to divide the work
						and plan deadlines for task completion. This worked well to organize the team and keep everyone on track.
					</p>

					<h3 style="text-align:left">Deciding on the Problem Space</h3>
					<p class="protopara">
						Although the point of this project was to learn how to use the tools we gathered
						from class and not necessarily to develop a fully functional prototype, we were still encouraged
						to create a final solution. I found it extremely important to narrow down the problem space and
						hone in on users' needs based on data, and NOT diverge unncessarily. Although many different
						alternatives and paths are possible, at some point decisions need to be made.
						If during the process something isn't working, then you can start over knowing what didn't work,
						but to not start at all is detrimental to the iterative process.
					</p>

					<h3 style="text-align:left">Research Methodologies</h3>
					<p class="protopara">
						Most importantly, this project allowed me to develop research techniques and has
						given me a well of resources and experiences to draw from. Designing is always about learning
						and continuing to learn and grow.
