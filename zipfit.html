								<h2>Research &amp; Analysis </h2>
							<br>
							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Introduction to the problem</h3>
							<p> We started out with specific stores within the Gap corporation umbrella that included Old Navy,
								Gap and Banana Republic. Through research from P1 and P2, we realized that our final re-design or
								solution would encompass and benefit not just the Gap brands, but similar stores across the retail
								platform. We therefore expanded our focus to incorporate general clothing stores.
							</p>
							<p>
								The biggest issue that we found and wanted to improve was the fitting room process.
								Our research repeatedly found customers were 71% more likely to purchase an item after
								trying it on, making the fitting room have a huge impact on customers’ purchase decision.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our problem space was refined to developing a system that will help customers be able to
								choose an item and get a fitting room more quickly and efficiently, while improving customer
								service productivity and helping communication between customers and store associates.
							</p>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Research Methods</h3>
							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li><b>Literature and market research</b></li>
								<li><b>In context observations:</b> Went to Gap stores (Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic).
									Took pictures of store layout to determine what the context was.</li>
								<li><b>Task Analyses:</b> How to shop online vs. in store and fitting room process.</li>
								<li><b>Comparative Analysis of Physical Stores and Online Stores:</b> Did extensive
									comparative analysis between the stores Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic.</li>
								<li><b>Interviews:</b> Asked store associates questions regarding their observations
									of who shopped at the store, what customers’ main needs are, what their
									experiences are and what their role or functions are, and how they thought
									they achieved their goals within the store, and what would make it easier for
									them to achieve these goals.</li>
								<li><b>Surveys:</b> Used online survey to get people’s opinions on current clothing shopping
									experience, and to understand the basic user needs.
								</li>
							</ul>


							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Understanding the User</h3>
							<img class="float-right" src="images/affinitymap2.png" alt="" style="max-height:450px;"/>

							<h4>Interviews</h4>
							<p>Learn about users shopping habits, pain points, and most importantly what do they want to improve.
								Use the insights from people’s definition of ideal shopping experience to develop our concept design</p>

							<h4>Affinity mapping</h4>
							<p>We used affinity mapping to analyse the interview result. Generate themes,
								highlight points from the result.</p>

							<h4> Personas </h4>
							<p>We created persona to help us target users needs, and to focus on helping users achieve their goals
								throughout the developing process.</p>
							<img src="images/Gary.png" alt="" style="max-width:33%;"/>
							<img src="images/Gabrielle.png" alt="" style="max-width:33%;"/>
							<img src="images/Gloria.png" alt="" style="max-width:33%;"/>
							<p style="text-align:center">Personas from left to right: Gary, Gabrielle, Gloria</p>

 							<h4>Customer journey map (in-context acting) </h4>
							<p>We did in-context acting and observation (sort-of cognitive walkthrough) to help us identify the pain
								points in the traditional shopping experience.
								Then use that insight to find potential area that we can develop design solution for.</p>
							<img src="images/journeymap1.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:90%;"/>
							<img src="images/journeymap2.jpg" alt="" style="max-width:90%;"/>
							<p style="text-align:center">Journey maps</p>

 							<h4> Storyboards </h4>
							<p> Use storyboard to demonstrate the “before and after” shopping experience so we
								have a clear idea of what problem we are solving.</p>
							<img src="images/storyboard1.jpg" alt="" style="max-height:350px;"/>
							<img src="images/storyboard2.jpg" alt="" style="max-height:350px;"/>
							<p style="text-align:center">Storyboards from left to right: Vikki, Vishnu, Grace</p>


							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Findings</h3>
							<p>We discovered that people who tried on clothing are <b>71%</b>
								more likely to purchase the items than people who just browsed the sales floor. To us, this meant
							that fitting rooms played a huge factor in customers' ultimate decision-making process.
							We found various problems with how current fitting rooms operate:</p>
							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li> The customer needs a different size but will have to put their own clothes back on to go get it.</li>
								<li> Dirty fitting rooms make the impression on customers that the clothes are cheap.</li>
								<li> Lighting and mirrors aren't flattering. </li>
								<li> Lines are too long.</li>
								<li> Item restrictions.</li>
							</ul>

								<h2>Design</h2>
									<br>
									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Requirements</h3>
									<p>
										Core functionality of app should deal with the following three points below
									</p>
									<ul style="text-align:left;">
										<li>Choosing right size and style</li>
										<li>Better Physical Features in fitting room facilities</li>
										<li>More efficient and flexible customer services</li>
										<li>Allowing customers to have more control over the shopping and fitting room process</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										Our final design will focus primarily on interactive technology that will help the general
										population of shoppers and attendants communicate about sizes and product availability more
										effectively and efficiently, while also giving the customer more control over the process of
										finding clothes that fit well to increase incentive to purchase them.
									</p>


									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Ideation</h3>
									<h4>Personalized Customer Service</h4>
									<img src="images/personalized.png" alt="" style="max-height:400px;">
									<br>
									<br>
									<h4>Independent Usage System</h4>
									<img src="images/independentusage.png" alt="" style="max-height:400px;">
									<br>
									<br>
									<h4>Body Scanner and Kiosk</h4>
									<img src="images/bodyscannerkiosk.png" alt="" style="max-height:400px;">

									<br>
									<br>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Feedback</h3>

								<p>
									As a team, we presented our final three solutions to four people, asking them various questions
									about our design ideas. A consensus appeared where many of the people preferred design solution 2,
									the tablet focused solution. Based on their feedback, we re-designed this solution to incorporate
									some main suggestions and also wireframed the screens for the second round of feedback sessions.
								</p>

								<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
									<li>Is this something that they would use? Usability, does the system meet the user needs?</li>
									<li>Which feature would make you most likely to use it? Does user perceive the benefits of the system?.</li>
									<li>Do you think this system would help make customer service faster?
										Identified user need from previous research</li>
									<li>Would this would allow you to have more control over your shopping and fitting room experience?
										Identified user need from previous research </li>
									<li>Is there anything you want to change or add? Usability, informing next design iteration(s).</li>
									<li>Which solution would be more useful? Informing next design iteration.</li>
								</ul>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Feedback Results</h3>

									<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
										<li>Independently Shopping vs. Shopping with Associate Assistance -
											Participants think the tablet or smartphone can give them more independence.</li>
										<li>Feasibility and Accuracy - The body scanning/kiosk concept was NOT as practical
											or achievable as the other two concepts.</li>
										<li>Come back later to try on - Provide estimated waiting time before customers confirm a request.</li>
										<li>Tablet or smartphone - Customers don’t want to download multiple apps for every store.
											We stuck with the tablet, customers can just walk into the store and use the tablets provided.</li>
										<li>Privacy - For the body scanning/kiosk concept, privacy is the biggest problem that
											we cannot solve currently.</li>
										<li>Store Associates - Having enough excellent associates could be difficult to achieve. How many associates the store
											can hire depends on the company.</li>
										<li>How can I find right size? - Trying on another size is still necessary for all solutions except
											the scanning/kiosk idea.</li>

								<h3 style="text-align:left;">Wireframe Feedback</h3>

								<p>
									We asked four users to critique our wireframes, asking them the same set of questions that we
									used for the sketch designs in our ideation phase. During the wireframe stage, we also included a
									longer question with a 1-to-7 Likert scale where we asked the subjects to rate different features
									of the prototype:
									<b>On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 “Hate it” and 7 being “Love it,” how would you rank the following features?</b>
									<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
										<li> Barcode scan </li>
										<li> Product Details  </li>
										<li> Add to Bag </li>
										<li> Try on Now </li>
										<li> Wait Estimate </li>
										<li> Confirm / Cancel option </li>
										<li> Continue Shopping/Scanning options </li>
										<li> Request Change </li>
										<li> Confirm Change Request </li>
									</ul>

								<p>
									While the responses were scaled, the subjects were still encouraged to “think aloud”
									and comment on the prototype. The purpose of this question was to gather user feedback
									to inform our design process as we iterated. User feedback on the various features helps
									our decision-making process regarding features and changes in subsequent iterations.

								<h3 style="text-align:left;">Accessibility</h3>
								<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
									<li> Language: Our system should provide language settings where users can select a prefered language.</li>
									<li> Illiterate Population: One way to do this is to have an audio reader for the texts,
										telling them which button to press using visual indication, but using the same interface.
										The other way is to have the system switch to using an entirely auditorial mode where the
										customer interacts with system using audio commands. </li>
									<li> “Help” Option: We decided that we should include a tutorial for the system after we received
										feedback regarding this, but it is still useful to have a “help” option. This can be used to call
										assistants for service, getting tips for using system, etc. </li>
									<li> Color Contrast: Make sure colors are visible and easily contrasted </li>
									<li> Font Size: Normal text is in 24 pt font, large text for important messages are in 30 pt font,
										small paragraphs and trivial information are in 18 pt and 14 pt font. </li>
									<li> Text Readability: We are using Roboto for our font. Since there are no long paragraphs on
										our system, the sans-serif fonts allow better legibility.</li>
									<li> Button Size and Status: We have the buttons big enough and easily differentiable for users to
										reduce their chances of making mistakes. The buttons will have a reaction when pressed to give
										users feedback of what is going on.</li>

								<h2>Testing and Evaluation</h2>
							<br>


							<h3 style="text-align:left;">3 Cognitive Walkthroughs</h3>

							<p>
								By using ‘expert’ users for cognitive walkthroughs, we wanted to determine whether specific
								tasks and their action sequence to complete the tasks were comprehensible and executable.
								We also wanted to determine if there was enough feedback given to the user for them to know
								that the task was successful.
							</p>

							<p>
								Having ‘expert’ users test the system allows us to hone in on specific key tasks within our design
								that we want evaluated. This gives us a chance to further define what is confusing, what is successful
								and what isn’t. This would allow us to understand the weaknesses of our design and how we would
								resolve tasks that resulted in failure for the ‘expert’ user. Ideally, this would allow us to refine
								the design before having real users test the system when doing usability tests.
							</p>

							<h4>Task 1</h4>
							<p>Selecting Item and Scanning</p>
							<p>Action Sequence:</p>
							<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Enter name</li>
								<li>Scan barcode</li>
								<li>Choose color</li>
								<li>Choose size</li>
								<li>Send item to “bag”</li>
								<li>Request fitting room</li>
							</ol>


							<h4>Task 2</h4>
							<p>Cancel Request</p>
							<p>Action Sequence:</p>
							<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Cancel request</li>
							</ol>

							<h4>Task 3</h4>
							<p>Change clothing size in fitting room</p>
							<p>Action Sequence:</p>
							<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Choose item</li>
								<li>Select different size</li>
								<li>Request to change item</li>
							</ol>

							<h4> Questions asked after every step in the action sequences:</h4>
							<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>What is the user’s task?</li>
								<li>Will the user know what the correct action is?</li>
								<li>Will the user be able to tell what action will achieve their task?</li>
								<li>Will the user receive any feedback regarding if the task was successful or not?</li>
							</ol>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">5 Usability Tests</h3>
							<p>Through usability testing, we want to get feedback from users, identify any usability problems,
								collect quantitative and qualitative data and determine their satisfaction with our design.
								Specifically, we want to know if people can use our app easily and smoothly, if they can get what
								they want by using our app, if our app actually solves or at least releases their problems, and if
								there’s anything that we can improve.
							</p>

							<p>
								Usability testing gives us the chance to identify problems before our design is coded. The earlier
								issues are identified and solved, the less work we need to do later. Through usability testing, we
								will be able to know if users are able to complete specified tasks successfully and find out how
								satisfied participants are with our app.
							</p>


							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Roles: 1 moderator, 1 notetaker, 1 playing store assistant, 1 facilitator</li>
								<li> Artifacts: We set up the physical space with 3 separate spaces: store-front,
									fitting room, back storage. We provided tablets that has our prototype implemented,
									we put fake clothes on hangers and displayed them as samples.
								</li>
								<li>Procedure: We gave participants an intro of our prototype and this evaluation activity.
									We gave them the same set of tasks that we used in expert evaluation, but added in the physical
									interaction with store associates and artifacts, to provide a more virtual , in-context experience.
									We asked them to think aloud during the process.</li>
									<li> After users completed the tasks, we asked 2 probing questions
										<br>
											Is this more helpful than a traditional system/fitting room experience?
											<br>
											What would you like to improve or change about this process?</li>
									<li>SUS ratings</li>
							</ul>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Findings</h3>

							<img class="pure-img wireframe" src="images/issuesgraph.jpg" alt="">

							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Confused by what “call” means, phone number or name?</li>
								<li>Don’t know whether adding more items will change the waiting time to go try on.</li>
								<li>Think (suggest) fitting rooms to be assigned to them when they send the clothes to store</li>
								<li>Wait time is long.</li>
								<li>Confused about where to find change sizes.</li>
								<li>Want to see change size (color) option directly on screen once they get in the fitting room.</li>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">User Centered Design</h3>
							<img class="float-right" src="images/UCD.png" alt="" style="max-width: 500px;"/>
							<p>
								The approach we took when starting on Infograin was based on the user centered design process,
								where you first research the problem space, ideate and design, prototype, evaluate and test
								then iterate again and again. This method argues that this is always a formative process and
								it never reaches the summative process, because the solution can always be improved upon.
							</p>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Improvements</h3>
							<p>
								Although Infograin was only a semester long project, there were definitly many aspects to
								our design that could be changed. Given more time to work, we would want to implement
								the following features:
							</p>

							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Launch a survey to help us determine understandable terminology.</li>
								<li>Remove the wait time for pulling up items.</li>
								<li>Enable the functionality to choose more than one size.</li>
								<li>Make the change size or color option directly show up when in the fitting room.</li>
								<li>Make the tabs for the main shopping page and item list more prominent, and highlight the
									selected tab with a better color contrast.</li>
							</ul>

								<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<br>

								<p>
									This project taught me a lot about designing with the user in mind and the user centered process.
								</p>
								<p>
									I learned that going into the project, there were a lot of assumptions my team and I made regarding
									what the user would understand and how they would interact with the prototype. While it is important
									to listen to users, especially when it comes down to an element that is confusing or is not easily intuitive,
									it is equally as important to NOT develop a system that gives the user everything they want.
								</p>
								<p>
									Not only is it impossible to cater to all the demands that every single user wants, one should not try.
									Rather, it is better to rely on the data and the trends revealed to inform the design process.
								</p>
								<p>
									Fail, and fail often. While we were only able to through the iteration process a couple of times from the
									low fidelity mockups to the final prototype, if given time, it is better to rapidly prototype, test and iterate
									and do this repeatedly. This helps the team discover what works and what doesn't faster.
