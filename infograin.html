								<h2>Research &amp; Analysis </h2>
							<br>
							<img class="float-right" src="images/affinitymap.jpg" alt="" style="max-height:500px;"/>
							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Initial Assumption</h3>
							<p> We started with determining the user group and finding the problem space.
								At the beginning, we defined the users as 'students with dietary restrictions' and the problem space as 'grocery shopping.'
								We conducted observations, interviews, and created surveys to gather more data regarding their experiences.
								Although students do have trouble navigating a grocery store on their first few visits, after the first few times they
								become accustome to the store and no longer require assistance. We found that students already have a set of
								methods and practices they use for finding food items that meet their dietary needs.
							</p>
							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Pivoting</h3>
							<p> Our initial assumption needed to be tweaked.
								We found a burgeoning trend from our data that students face more frustrations when trying to
								decide where to go out to eat and discovering what food items meet their dietary needs at restaurants.
								We made a decision to pivot our problem space to
							<br>
								restaurant going instead of grocery shopping.
							</p>
							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Findings</h3>
							<p> By doing an affinity map, we were able to extract key pain points:</p>
							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li> Obtaining ingredients and nutritional information </li>
								<li> Facing social stigma </li>
								<li> Trouble with language barriers </li>
								<li> Travelling to restaurant </li>
							</ul>

								<h3 style="text-align:left;">Personas</h3>
								<p>
									We wanted to further understand our users
									so that we could decide what, specifically, they would make use of in our solution.
									We created three personas, one each for vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free.
									For each persona, we defined their characteristics, challenges they face with their
									dietary restrictions and goals when eating out.

							<br>
								<h3 style="text-align:left;">Empathy Maps</h3>

									We used storyboards to represent scenarios our personas were likely to face and to show how
									our design ideas would resolve some of these problems. Using the empathy maps as a guide, we created a
									storyboard for each persona.

								<h2>Design</h2>
									<br>
									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Wireframes</h3>
									<p>
										While working on the storyboards, we started sketching up low fidelity mockups for three different
										solutions: a QR code app, AR app, and a kiosk. We then made wireframes to develop our ideas further.
									</p>
									<h4>QR Code App</h4>
									<img src="images/QR_1.png" alt="" style="max-height:325px;">
									<img src="images/QR_2.png" alt="" style="max-height:325px;">

									<br>
									<h4>Kiosk</h4>
									<img src="images/kiosk.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%;">

									<br>
									<br>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Feedback</h3>

								<p>
									We conducted six feedback sessions with users to see which design we should move forward with.
									We asked them to answer the following questions:
								</p>
								<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
									<li>What are 3 pros and cons of this app?</li>
									<li>Is there a scenario in which you see yourself using this app? (If yes, please explain the scenario).</li>
									<li>Would you prefer making a profile on this app before using it or not?</li>
									<li>If you had to make a profile, what information would you be willing to provide?</li>
									<li>Is there anything else you would like to add or have questions about?</li>
								</ul>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Feedback Results</h3>

									<ol style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
										<li>People like having the ability to make fine-grained distinctions about their dietary restriction</li>
										<li>People are neutral-to-negative about creating a profile</li>
										<li>People bring a lot of expectations for the app from Yelp</li>
										<li>People won't use QR</li>
										<li>People are generally very hesitant about AR</li>
										<li>Many participants imagine using this in a group setting</li>
									</ol>

								<h3 style="text-align:left;">Refinement</h3>

								<p class="protopara">
									We created mid fidelity prototypes without color and asked a user to review or app
									to help us understand on a higher level what the user perceived from each screen.
									This feedback session consisted of only one question:
									<b>"What do you understand from this screen and how do you perceive the information?"</b>
								</p>
								<p class="protopara">
									This resulted in two main findings:

										<div class="pure-u-1-3 pure-u-lg-1-3">

													2. The legends on the menu page were not comprehensible to the user and the
													user felt that the legends provided were for the whole restaurant till they
													saw the expanded menu categorization. This made us change the design from all
													collapsed categories when the user first navigates to the menu page, to having
													the first category expanded by default so that the user could make sense of the
													legends. We also changed the text for the legends to make it more descriptive
													and easier for the user to understand. (See figure below)

									After coming up with our basic screens, we came together again to talk
									about the color scheme for our app. In talking about the "personality",
									or feel, for our app (described above), we decided that we wanted to go
									with a mentor sort of feel – friendly and approachable, but also in a
									position of authority. We want people to be comfortable using the app,
									but we also want them to trust it. We kept this in mind as we picked the
									color scheme. Ultimately, we decided on purple and yellow, with variations
									on these shades of purple and yellow being determined by Google's material
									design palettes.

								<h2>Testing</h2>

							<h2>SUS SCORE: 80</h2>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Usability Testing</h3>

							<h4>Task 1</h4>
							<p>Pick a restaurant in this area where you would like to eat, keeping your dietary restriction in mind.</p>
							<h4>Scenario Constraint</h4>
							<p>For this task, you only have the maps view available to you and you cannot drill down and click on
								the restaurant to view their menu.</p>
							<h4>Significance</h4>
							<p>We chose this task because we wanted to see what users considered when choosing a restaurant when
								they only had the option to look at the maps view. We were interested in how people made the decision
								of what restaurant to go to, independent of what was on the menu. In particular, we were interested
								in the relative priority of each bit of information to the user – how interested were they in the
								rating, price, and distance of each restaurant?
							</p>

							<h4>Task 2</h4>
							<p>Pick a dish from a given restaurant.</p>
							<h4>Scenario Constraint</h4>
							<p>You are going with a friend who does not have any dietary restriction and you need to pick a dish
								for them as well.</p>
							<h4>Significance</h4>
							<p>We chose this task to evaluate the other primary feature of our app: the menu. Designating a
								restaurant for them and forcing them to choose was partly an artifact of the fidelity of our
								prototype, but we believe it is also a relatively realistic task. Our research throughout this
								project has indicated that people with dietary restrictions often have to go to a restaurant that
								someone else chooses when they're out with friends, coworkers, or family.
							</p>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Improvements Based On Findings</h3>

							<h4>Dietary Restrictions Page</h4>
							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Simplify the explanation accompanying the name of the dietary restriction by making use of icons
									and symbols.</li>
								<li>Deactivate dietary restrictions that are incompatible with the currently selected restrictions.
									For example, if a person selects that they are vegan, then the app would deactivate the "Lacto-Ovo
									Vegetarian" option. However fun a Schrodinger's Restriction is to think about, it would be
									impossible.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Map Page</h4>
							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Make the sort option a bit more noticeable.</li>
								<li>Change the price sorting option to sort from ‘low to high’ by default.
									Have ‘low to high’ sorting for price, ‘closest to farthest’ for distance,
									and ‘high to low’ for ratings.</li>
								<li>Add cuisine to the restaurant card. </li>
								<li>Add filters within the sorting options to specify a range for sorting parameters.
									For instance, people can specify they're interested in only restaurants with a match
									score above 4, or can specify they only want results for restaurants within a certain mileage.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Menu Page</h4>
							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Add three legends for ‘food that fits dietary restriction’ - green,
									‘food that fits dietary restriction with substitution’ - yellow,
									and ‘food that doesn't fit dietary restriction’ - red.</li>
								<li>When users click on one of these legends, show them menu items falling under respective legends.</li>
								<li>Either remove menu toggle or make the instructions more explicit.</li>
								<li>Add legend in front of menu items which do not fit dietary restriction.</li>

							<p>
								The approach we took when starting on Infograin was based on the user centered design process,
								where you first research the problem space, ideate and design, prototype, evaluate and test
								then iterate again and again. This method argues that this is always a formative process and
								it never reaches the summative process, because the solution can always be improved upon.
							</p>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Continuation</h3>
							<p>
								Although Infograin was only a semester long project, there were definitly many aspects to
								our design that could be changed. Given more time to work, we would want to implement
								the following features:
							</p>
							<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left: 25px;">
								<li>Clarify the color scheme to be less confusing and more consistent</li>
								<li>Add feature to allow multiple users to connect through the app and use simulataneously</li>
								<li>Clean up UI for more polished and standardized look</li>
								<li>Strengthen and clean up customer feedback and reviews feature</li>
							</ul>

							<h3 style="text-align:left;">Reflection</h3>
							<p>
								This project taught me a lot about designing with the user in mind and the user centered process.
							</p>
							<p>
								I learned that going into the project, there were a lot of assumptions my team and I made regarding
								what the user would understand and how they would interact with the prototype. While it is important
								to listen to users, especially when it comes down to an element that is confusing or is not easily intuitive,
								it is equally as important to NOT develop a system that gives the user everything they want.
							</p>
							<p>
								Not only is it impossible to cater to all the demands that every single user wants, one should not try.
								Rather, it is better to rely on the data and the trends revealed to inform the design process.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fail, and fail often. While we were only able to through the iteration process a couple of times from the
								low fidelity mockups to the final prototype, if given time, it is better to rapidly prototype, test and iterate
								and do this repeatedly. This helps the team discover what works and what doesn't faster.
